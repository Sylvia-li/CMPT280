Question 1
	a.)O(n^4log_280 n)
	b.)O(n^2 log(n^2))
	c.)O(29log_2 n)
	
Question 2
	1.)False
	2.)False
	3.)True
	4.)True

Question 3
	a.)O(n^2)
	b.)O(2^n)*O(n^2)
	c.)O(n^3)
	d.)O(n^2log_2(n^2))

Question 4
	a.)
The first for-loop will run n times. THe inner for loop runs 2 statements (including the conditional in the forloop) so it runs 2n times,
Therefor, because the inner loop runs another n times by the first for-loop it will be 2n^2. the total statements will be 2n^2 + n
	b.) Θ(n^2)

Question 5
	a.) First line is run once, the first for-loop runs n times and the second inner for-loop runs the condition + the 
print statement (n(n+1)/2) times (summation).
1 + n + (2(n(n+1)/2)) 
	b.) Θ(n^2)

Question 6
The second for-loop is our active operation. it runs n^2 times. Θ(n^2)

Question 7
Our active operation will be the while loop as nothing else runs repetitively as much as the while loop. Why? The first line of pseudocode
data.gofist() is usuallly O(1) as inserting at the first index doesn't need any iterating over of the array. Found = False is
also O(1) as it is just setting the value.
